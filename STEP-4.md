# Step 4 - Webpack Plugins

## Part 1

Let’s install a plugin. The first one we’re going to install is called HtmlWebPackPlugin. This plugin will create an html file and allow us to create dynamic references to our bundled files.

```
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
```


Most plugins need to be required at the top of our webpack config file, so we need to add this line:


```
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin")
```

Then we need to set up the plugin add this section to the module.exports portion of the config file:

```
plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
        template: "./src/client/views/index.html",
        filename: "./index.html",
    })
]
```

Remove your dist folder and rebuild.

## Part 2

This new set up changes a few things.

First, we might as well remove all other references to scripts in our html file - because webpack is going to add them for us.

You might also have caught on to the other thing we need to change. A very important shift has taken place now that webpack is generating an html file for us - we have two html files, so which one is our user going to see when we run the server?

Our user will still see our html file at client/views/index.js - because that is still what express is told to serve. In order to use the new html file being generated by webpack, we have to tell express to serve that file. Go to your server/index.js file and change the home route to this:

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.sendFile('dist/index.html')
})

See how the file we are sending back from express is now the index.html file inside of dist? That is what we want. But we ought to carry this even further. Express was set up to find other assets as well - it expected all our css and js files to come from the client folder. But that won’t be the case any more, our assets are all going to be handled by webpack, so they are all going to come from the dist folder, so change this line:

app.use(express.static('src/client'))

**You have been successful when can run your express server and see our web page with no styles**
